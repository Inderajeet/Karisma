            "Benefits: Hair Loss Threads are absorbable threads inserted into the scalp to stimulate collagen production and improve circulation. This non-invasive method enhances the scalp environment, helping nourish hair follicles and reduce hair loss.",
            "Use: Best for individuals with early-stage hair loss seeking a minimally invasive restoration treatment.",
